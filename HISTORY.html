      <h3><font color="FFFFCC"><BIG>WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF INTERNET OF THINGS?</h3></font></BIG>
      
<div class="hist">The idea of adding sensor and intelligence to basic objects was discussed throughout the 1980s and 1990s (and there are arguably some 
much earlier ancestors), but apart from some early projects -- including an internet-connected vending machine -- progress was slow 
simply because the technology wasn't ready.<br></br>
Processors that were cheap and power-frugal enough to be all but disposable were required before it became cost-effective to connect 
up billions of devices. The adoption of RFID tags -- low-power chips that can communicate wirelessly -- solved some of this issue, along
 with the increasing availability of broadband internet and cellular and wireless networking. The adoption of IPv6 -- which, among 
other things, should provide enough IP addresses for every device the world (or indeed this galaxy) is ever likely to need -- was also a 
necessary step for the IoT to scale. Kevin Ashton coined the phrase 'Internet of Things' in 1999, although it took at least another decade 
for the technology to catch up with the vision.
<br></br>The concept of IoT started to gain some popularity in the summer of 2010. Information leaked that Google’s StreetView service had not only made 360 degree pictures but had also stored tons of data of people’s Wifi networks. People were debating whether this was the start of a new Google strategy to not only index the internet but also index the physical world.The same year, the Chinese government announced it would make the Internet of Things a strategic priority in their Five-Year-Plan.In 2011, Gartner, the market research company that invented the famous “hype-cycle for emerging technologies” included a new emerging phenomenon on their list: “The Internet of Things”

<h3>How big is the Internet of Things?</h3>
<div class="hist">Big and getting bigger -- there are already more connected things than people in the world. Analyst Gartner calculates that around
 8.4 billion IoT devices were in use in 2017, up 31 percent from 2016, and this will likely reach 20.4 billion by 2020. Total spending on IoT
 endpoints and services will reach almost $2tn in 2017, with two-thirds of those devices found in China, North America and Western 
Europe, said Gartner.
Out of that 8.4 billion devices, more than half will be consumer products like smart TVs and smart speakers. The most-used enterprise
 IoT devices will be smart electric meters and commercial security cameras, according to Gartner.
