      <h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
<ol type="1">
<b>  <li>Smart Home</li></b>
  <dd>The cost of owning a house is the biggest expense in a homeowner’s life. Smart Home products are promised to save time, energy and money. With Smart home companies like Nest, Ecobee, Ring and August, to name a few, will become household brands and are planning to deliver a never seen before experience.</dd>
  <b><li>Wearables</li></b>
<dd>Wearable devices are installed with sensors and softwares which collect data and information about the users. This data is later pre-processed to extract essential insights about user.
These devices broadly cover fitness, health and entertainment requirements. The pre-requisite from internet of things technology for wearable applications is to be highly energy efficient or ultra-low power and small sized.</dd>
  <b><li>Connected Cars</li></b>
<dd>The automotive digital technology has focused on optimizing vehicles internal functions. But now, this attention is growing towards enhancing the in-car experience.
A connected car is a vehicle which is able to optimize it’s own operation, maintenance as well as comfort of passengers using onboard sensors and internet connectivity.</dd>
 <b><li> Industrial Internet</li></b>
<dd>Industrial Internet is the new buzz in the industrial sector, also termed as Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ). It is empowering industrial engineering with sensors, software and big data analytics to create brilliant machines.IIoT holds great potential for quality control and sustainability. Applications for tracking goods, real time information exchange about inventory among suppliers and retailers and automated delivery will increase the supply chain efficiency. According to GE the improvement industry productivity will generate $10 trillion to $15 trillion in GDP worldwide over next 15 years.</dd>
<b><li>Smart Cities</li></b>
<dd>Smart city is another powerful application of IoT generating curiosity among world’s population. Smart surveillance, automated transportation, smarter energy management systems, water distribution, urban security and environmental monitoring all are examples of internet of things applications for smart cities.
By installing sensors and using web applications, citizens can find free available parking slots across the city. Also, the sensors can detect meter tampering issues, general malfunctions and any installation issues in the electricity system.</dd>
 <b><li>IoT in agriculture</li></b>
<dd>With the continous increase in world’s population, demand for food supply is extremely raised. Governments are helping farmers to use advanced  techniques and research to increase food production. Smart farming is one of the fastest growing field in IoT.
Farmers are using meaningful insights from the data to yield better return on investment. Sensing for soil moisture and nutrients, controlling water usage for plant growth and determining custom fertilizer are some simple uses of IoT.</dd>
 <b><li>Energy Engagement</li></b>
<dd>Power grids of the future will not only be smart enough but also highly reliable. Smart grid concept is becoming very popular all over world.
The basic idea behind the smart grids is to collect data in an automated fashion and analyze the behavior or electricity consumers and suppliers for improving efficiency as well as economics of electricity use.
Smart Grids will also be able to detect sources of power outages more quickly and at individual household  levels like near by solar panel, making possible distributed energy system.</dd>
